      "receipe": " On an open gas top flame or a cast iron skillet, roast the peppers and corn, rotating every 2-3 minutes until all sides are nicely charred.  Remove from heat.  Place peppers in a bowl and cover with a plate to allow to steam and soften (approx. 5 minutes).\n\n Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium heat, add sunflower oil, thyme, and garlic and sauté for 1 minute.\n\n Add wild rice and stir to coat well.  Allow rice to toast slightly by stirring occasionally for one minute.\n\n Add vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a low boil.  Reduce to simmer.  Cover and cook for 20-35 minutes.\n\n While the rice cooks, prepare the peppers and corn.  Dice the pepper, cutting off stems and scraping out seeds. Leave the skin on the pepper for more flavor.  Remove corn from the cob by placing the flat side of the cob against a surface and running a knife down the side of the cob removing the kernels. \n\n Once the rice is fully cooked, fold in the peppers and corn.",
